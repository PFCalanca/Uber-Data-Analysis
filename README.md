# Uber-Data-Analysis

Here I'm analyzing some data from Uber, aiming to practice some EDA skills.

**Questions I'll try to answer:**
- How far do people travel by Uber?
- What time do people use Uber the most?
- What is the purpose of the trip?
- Which day has the most trips?
- How many trips per day?
- How many trips per month?
- Where do most people leave and go from?

I got the data from Kaggle: [Uber Drives](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zusmani/uberdrives)
